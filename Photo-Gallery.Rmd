I added this file after seeing Hadley's suggestion to do this in an R markdown chunk.

```{r, results ="asis", echo = FALSE}
fig_files <- dir(pattern = "png$", path = "./Bugs/Bugs_files") 
cat(paste0("* ", fig_files, " ![](", fig_files, ")\n"))

fig_files <- dir(pattern = "png$", path = "./Diets/Diets_files") 
cat(paste0("* ", fig_files, " ![](", fig_files, ")\n"))
```
